# Gambas-MurderMystery
A Murder Mystery game facilitator written in Gambas

This program can be used to select each players secret role for the Murder Mystery game.

Each player is either a killer, a witness or an innocent guest. Using this facilitator saves having 1 person sit the game out in order to be the game facilitator (i.e. the facilitator normally knows all the other players roles, so cannot play the game themselves).
