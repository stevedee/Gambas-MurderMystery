Its Boxing Day at Buchan House. Last night Lord &amp; Lady Edwards held
a Christmas dinner party and all guests were invited to stay the night.<br>
<br>
At about 2.30am this morning, Lord Edwards was forced from his bed by
his notoriously weak bladder and, while crossing the main hall at the
foot of the stairs, was beaten savagely by 2 cowardly killers using his
own bone handle walking sticks!<br>
<br>
Fortunately someone else was moving about at the top of the stairs,
having just left the bedroom of a fellow guest. By the dim light of the
Christmas tree lights, they were able to witness the act and to catch a
glimpse of the face of one of the murderers ("...if only Lord Edwards had
properly repaired his fairy lights," said a tearful Lady Edwards, "the witness may have been able to
identify the second villain!" ).<br>
<br>
So your challenge (if you are innocent) is to identify the killers and
send them to the gallows. If you are a murderer you must avoid
detection.<br>
<br>
As a group you should discuss the incident and initially reach a consensus on the identity of the first killer.<br>
<br>
When there is a majority vote for a single suspect, that person is sent
to the gallows, and they must then truthfully reveal whether they are
indeed guilty, or that there has been a dreadful miscarriage of justice.<br>
<br>
The process is repeated until both killers are identified. If there are
only 2 players left (and one is a killer) the killer wins the game.<br>
<br>
No one is obliged to tell the truth (unless they are sent to the gallows) so...<br>
...TRUST NO ONE.<br>
<br>
<big><big style="font-style: italic;">The Murder Mystery Facilitator</big></big><br>
This program allows everyone in the group to play the game, as it
replaces the need for a game facilitator (i.e. someone who sets the
game up and knows the identity of both killers and the witness).<br>
<big style="font-style: italic;"><br>
&nbsp;To use this program</big><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 1;</span><br>
&nbsp;- Enter the name of each player. Use the "Add This Player" button.<br>
&nbsp;- As each name is added it will appear in the players list.<br>
&nbsp;- Click the "OK, all players added" button when all have been added.<br>
&nbsp;- A message box should show that the program has selected 2 killers and 1 witness. All other players are innocent.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
Stage 2;</span><br>
&nbsp;- Each player must now use the computer ensuring that no other players can see the screen<br>
&nbsp;- Click to highlight your name in the list<br>
&nbsp;- Click on "Check your role" and read the message box carefully:-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;*** If you are a Killer you will also see the identity of the other Killer<br>
&nbsp;*** If you are the Witness you will also see the identity of one of the two Killers<br>
&nbsp;*** If you are Innocent there will be no other information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- Remember to close the message box before passing the computer to the next player!<br>
<br>
To start a new game, go to menu "Game" &gt; "New Game". All player roles
will be reset, but selection is completely random (so you may have the
same role second time around).<br>
